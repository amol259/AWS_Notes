#Signing

Encryption does not prove idenity!
Takes robots private key, signs the doc, and then reader can verify that that document was signed w/ the private key but at no time is the private key revealed
Signing is used to verify identity

Think of writing on invisible ink  unless you know exaclty how to look for it
